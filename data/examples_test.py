    {"question": "Imagine you are a product manager at a subscription-based streaming service looking to reduce customer churn. Describe how churn-prediction insights can inform actionable pricing or content-delivery strategies for this service.",
    "answers": [
        "Churn prediction is a model that estimates which users are likely to cancel. It helps companies understand user behavior.",
        "By predicting churn, we can retain more customers because we know who might leave. This should help lower cancellation rates.",
        "Churn-prediction insights let us identify at-risk subscribers. We can then reach out to those users with retention campaigns to keep them subscribed longer.",
        "With churn predictions, we can flag at-risk subscribers and offer them personalized discounts—e.g., a 20% reduced monthly fee for users predicted to churn—to encourage them to stay.",
        "Churn-prediction lets us segment subscribers by risk level and tailor interventions. For high-risk users we might offer a targeted discount or a temporary promotional rate. For medium-risk users we could surface new or exclusive content recommendations based on their viewing history. We can also test dynamic pricing tiers—e.g., a flexible ad-supported plan—to see if an alternative package reduces cancellations. Finally, we can prioritize UX improvements (like push reminders) for at-risk cohorts, ensuring we address pain points that drive churn.",
